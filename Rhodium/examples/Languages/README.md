# Lake Model in Various Programming Languages

Herein are several examples demonstrating how to connect Rhodium to a model written in
various programming languages, including Python, C, and R.  To run each example
individually, see the `README.md` file contained in each subdirectory.

* [Python Example](Python)
* [C Example](C)
* [R Example](R)
* [Excel Example](Excel)

You can also see a speed comparison by running `python speedComparison.py`.  Each model is run for 10,000
evaluations.  The timing outputs are shown below (in seconds):

```
    Lake Model in Python: 365.2015163898468
    Lake Model in C: 42.53125262260437
    Lake Model in R: 556.8596804141998
    Lake Model in Excel: 189.12191033363342
